# 🌳 Binary Search Tree (BST)

A **Binary Search Tree** is a binary tree where each node follows the property:


This structure allows efficient **search**, **insertion**, and **deletion** in `O(log n)` time (on average, if balanced).

---

## 🧠 Why BST?

- Efficient lookup, insertion & deletion compared to arrays or linked lists.
- Backbone of many data structures like:
  - Sets & Maps (C++ STL, Java TreeMap)
  - Range trees
  - Self-balancing trees (AVL, Red-Black Tree)
- Foundation for advanced topics like Segment Trees & Treaps.
