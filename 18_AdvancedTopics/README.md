## 🧠 Tips to Tackle Advanced Topics

- Pick one area at a time (e.g., DSU or Suffix Arrays).
- Start with **standard problems**, then try **contest-level** variations.
- Understand both the **concept** and **implementation pattern**.
- Use visualizations/tools for algorithms like Trie, Mo’s Algorithm, and HLD.
