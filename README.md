# 🚀 DSA 150+ Problem Set – Topic-wise Structured

Welcome to my personal repository of the most important **DSA problems** for coding interviews and placements, organized **topic-wise** for focused learning.

> _“Striving to master DSA, one problem at a time.”_

## 📚 Structure Overview

All problems are organized in folders like:


Each `.cpp` file contains:
- 🚀 Problem link
- 📌 Short approach
- ✅ Optimized C++ solution
